# Reepz-7-Days-To-Die-Mod
A mod for 7 days to die featuring Reepz Models

## To Use

1.) Go to releases and download .zip file.

2.) Extract Reepz_Mod folder.

3.) Add Reepz_Mod folder into Mods folder directory in 7 Days to Die.

4.) Enjoy!


## Notes
This mod changes spawns (entitygroups) to add reepz models into 7 Days to Die. It is not compatible with any other mod that changes spawning. Original zombies are still present. I have only 4 models to work with, 4 zombies were replaced as a result. I will add more as I generate more models. If you liked this mod thank @miroweb3 on twitter for his efforts.
